<:2mate:773599716729683999>**Mate** is a
bot specially designed for the Anoxin's
Official Discord server, but anyway it
can be used within other Discord server
as well.

<:2mate:773599716729683999>**Mate** Project
meant to be open-source, so everyone can take
apart in bot developing and suggest their great
ideas.

<:2mate:773599716729683999>**Mate** uses icons
(except the bot avatar and icon image) provided
by the Icons8 website, so we pass the link to
their website due to terms of use.
[Icons by Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/)

<:2mate:773599716729683999>**Mate** helpful links
refer to official Anoxin's
Discord server and 2Mate's
Github page.
